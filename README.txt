My implementation uses a NodeJS backend along with a local Solr database and the frontend uses AngularJS.

How to use application:
1. Begin by searching for keywords either using Google Search or Solr Search.
2. Both search will bring a dialog window onto the screen with results.
3. Solr search result links will goto a detail page with the Lyrics from the Solr database.

If the Google Searchbar does not appear, you may have to disable adblocker and/or refresh the page.
